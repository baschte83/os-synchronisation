# Synchronisation

### Assignment, class and language
This is the solution to the assignment **Synchronisation** of class **operating systems 1,** written in Python (2.7) with my two team members [Korbinian Karl](https://github.com/korbster) and [Ehsan Moslehi](https://github.com/eca852).

### Requirements
To complete this assignment we had to write a program, that organizes three students who all want to lend three different books. In the library there are three copies of the first book b1 and two copies of the second book b2 and the third book b3. Every student wants to study for exams but is only able to study if he has a copy of every book. So every student tries to lend all three different books, but only two of them can lend them at once. A third student has to wait till one of the successful students gives his copies back. If a student returns his copies he immediately tries to lend them once more. Our task was to make sure, that the book copies are synchronized, so that the process of lending and returning books works correctly with three students (threads). 

It is hard to say what is exactly my part of the work because my team members and I worked most of the time together on one computer and corrected one another.
